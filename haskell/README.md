## Haskell implementation

Every exercise is on it own module file and all get imported in `Main.hs`


You can run and play with each individual problem by running the interpreter:

```bash
ghci ProblemN.hs
```

Inside the interpreter you can issue a `:reload` command to load any code change you made to the file


To compile and run the complete suite you can just issue

```bash
make
./euler
```

Clean any generated artifact with
```bash
make clean
```
